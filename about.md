### Research

My work investigates G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) structure and dynamics, a key target for therapeutic intervention.
Aims are to better understand GPCR activation mechanisms, and predict potential drug interactions with *in silico* methods

I am based at the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences working in
[Prof. Patrick Sexton's laboratory](http://www.monash.edu/pharm/research/areas/drug-discovery/laboratories/sexton.html).

### Extra

[COMBINE.org.au](http://combine.org.au/) is a student organisation for computational biology, and is also keeping me pretty busy!
I joined COMBINE in August 2013, and have been taking care of the web & comm aspect since March 2014. I am grateful to work with a
great group of people in organising workshops, seminars and social events. My latest highlight with COMBINE was organising and chairing the
[2014 COMBINE Student Symposium](http://combine.org.au/2015/01/10/2014-wrap-up-with-a-two-day-event-combine-student-symposium-and-python-workshop/)
