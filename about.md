### Research

My work investigates G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) structure and dynamics, a key target for therapeutic intervention.
Aims are to better understand GPCR activation mechanisms, and predict potential drug interactions with *in silico* methods

I am based at the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences 
working in [Prof. Patrick Sexton's laboratory](http://www.monash.edu/pharm/research/areas/drug-discovery/laboratories/sexton.html).
