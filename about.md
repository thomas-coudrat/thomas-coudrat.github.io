### Thesis

My work investigates G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) structure and dynamics. GPCRs are a large family of transmembrane protein that mediate signals to the cells, they are a coveted therapeutic target.
I aim to better understand GPCR activation mechanisms, and predict potential drug interactions with *in silico* methods

I am based at the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences 
working in [Prof. Patrick Sexton's laboratory](http://www.monash.edu/pharm/research/areas/drug-discovery/laboratories/sexton.html).
