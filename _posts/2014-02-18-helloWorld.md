I am currently attending the [ResBaz conference](http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/conference)
in Melbourne, a great initiative that brings together multidisciplinary researchers who have a
common goal of learning about and sharing their knowledge of digital tools. I
have been helping out with Python programming, and am currently improving my
knowledge of Git.

With the tool centric format of this conference, I found myself sharing
information about favourite tools more easily. That was further
facilitated by a "research tools" poster session, all attendees were asked to
fill out a poster template that focuses on the tools they use, and what they do
with them.

I have been wanting to start a simple website for a while, in order to have a
landing page that I control, and possibly to have a medium where I can share
research related write-ups. And thanks to #ResBaz, it has finally happened! I
was looking at the Cameron McLean's tool poster, and he had a [github.io webpage](https://cameronmclean.github.io)
(a web hosting solution I had been wanting to try). I found him at the conference
and within the day I had my first website running!

I used the Poole/Hyde template, and have started making changes to it: the
look of the website now may very well change quite a bit as I understand a bit
more about CSS syntax.

I must thank Cameron (@cammerschooner) for his kind help, and the ResBaz conference for
making this happen!
