<h3>Research</h3>

<p>My work focuses on G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs), which are a super-family of trans-membrane proteins that mediate an array of important
functions in the human body.
About a third of curently marketed drugs are targeting GPCRs, and GPCRs remain great targets to further therapeutic intervention on various diseases.</p>

<p>Understanding the structural basis for GPCR activation, complex GPCR pharmacology and ultimately drug binding are key to rational drug design.
I develop and apply <em>in silico</em> methods to answer such questions on a range of GPCR targets in the
<a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/pharm/research/areas/drug-discovery/">Drug Discovery Biology</a> laboratory.</p>

<p>I am a PhD candidate in
<a href="http://www.monash.edu/pharm/research/areas/drug-discovery/laboratories/sexton.html">Prof. Patrick Sexton&#39;s laboratory</a>.</p>

<h3>Community</h3>

<p><strong>COMBINE</strong> <a href="http://combine.org.au/">COMBINE.org.au</a> is the Australian student organisation for bioinformatics &amp; computational biology.
I joined COMBINE in August 2013 and have been on the national committee as <em>Web &amp; Communication</em> coordinator over 2014-15. During that time
we have grown COMBINE from its Melboure beginnings to a truely national organisation. I now remain a COMBINE Melbourne committee member and
participate in the organisation of local workshops, seminars and social events. My latest highlight with COMBINE was organising and chairing the
<a href="http://combine.org.au/2015/01/10/2014-wrap-up-with-a-two-day-event-combine-student-symposium-and-python-workshop/">2014 COMBINE Student Symposium</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Monash Parkville Forum</strong> The Monash Parkville Forum organises regular events inviting professionals from various sectors to present their career
journey. The aim is to empower young researchers, expose them to a multitude of career opportunities including in academia, law, industry, business
and communication and promote networking with our invited speakers.
I co-founded the <a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/pharm/about/events/whats-out-there.html">Monash Parkville Forum</a>
together with two other PhD candidates in July 2014, and we have run three successful events.</p>

<p><strong>Software Carpentry</strong> The Software Carpentry (SWC) Foundation is a non-profit volunteer organization whose members teach researchers basic software
skills. After helping at several SWC workshops, I undertook the training to become a certified SWC instructor. I have tought Python at a
<a href="http://combine-australia.github.io/2015-04-08-SWC-UniMelb-Biosciences/">COMBINE-organised workshop</a>, I find this to be a very rewarding
experience and I look forward to many more!</p>
